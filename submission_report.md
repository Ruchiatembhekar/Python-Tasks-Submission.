Slab: 1 – Beginners
Tasks Completed: ✅ 3 / 3

📌 Executive Summary

In this submission, I successfully completed all three beginner-level tasks assigned under Slab 1. The tasks involved data analysis & visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib, building an interactive Matrix Operations Tool with NumPy, and developing a House Price Prediction System using Linear Regression (Scikit-learn). Each task was implemented with clean, modular code and supported by datasets, visualizations, and interactive outputs. Through these tasks, I gained strong hands-on experience in Python programming, data science fundamentals, and machine learning basics.

🔹 Task 1: CSV Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib

📂 Loaded dataset (sales_data.csv) using Pandas.

📊 Performed descriptive analysis: mean, summary statistics, correlations.

📈 Created professional visualizations:

Bar Chart – Average Sales by Product

Scatter Plot – Price vs Sales Correlation

Heatmap – Correlation Matrix

Line Chart – Monthly Sales Trend

Pie Chart – Product Distribution

🔎 Key Insights:

Higher-priced products showed lower sales (negative correlation).

Product B contributed the **largest share of total sales (~40%)*.

Sales showed an upward seasonal trend from Jan to June.

🔹 Task 2: Matrix Operations Tool with NumPy

⚙️ Built an interactive tool for performing matrix operations.

➕ Implemented: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication.

🔄 Advanced Operations: Transpose, Determinant.

🖥️ User-friendly design: Matrices entered via console → results displayed in a structured format.

🔹 Task 3: House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

🏠 Created a structured housing dataset (house_dataset.csv) simulating real-world property data.

🧹 Preprocessed data: validated ranges, ensured positive prices.

🤖 Trained a Linear Regression model with Scikit-learn.

📊 Model Evaluation:

Achieved high R² (> 0.90) indicating strong predictive accuracy.

RMSE within acceptable range, ensuring reliable predictions.

🎯 Built an interactive prediction tool for users to input house details and get instant price estimates.

📈 Generated detailed visualizations:

Price Distribution Histogram

Scatter Plots (Rooms, Size, Location, Age vs Price)

Correlation Heatmap

🔎 Key Insights:

Size (sq ft) had the strongest positive impact on price.

Location score significantly increased predicted price.

Age of property reduced overall value (negative correlation).

🌟 Key Learning Outcomes

Efficient data manipulation & analysis using Pandas.

Professional data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Hands-on practice with matrix operations in NumPy.

Applied Machine Learning (Linear Regression) using Scikit-learn.

Designed interactive Python applications with structured outputs.

✅ All three beginner-level tasks (Slab 1) were successfully completed with working code, datasets, and visual outputs.
